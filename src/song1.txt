[Verse 1]
A          G/A
Tough, you think you've got the stuff
       F#m/A          Dsus2
You're telling me and anyone
A
You're hard enough
    A
You don't have to put up a fight
    G/A
You don't have to always be right
F#m/A                         Dsus2
      Let me take some of the punches
    A
For you tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
D   D             A
    Listen to me now
  A                F#m
I need to let you know
    F#m                  D
You don't have to go it alone
[Chorus]
         F#m                        E
And it's you when I look in the mirror
         D                              D
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
  F#m                E                  D     D
Sometimes you can't make it    on your own
[Verse 2]
   A                   G/A
We fight      all the time
        F#m/A           Dsus2
You and I...   that's alright
          A
We're the same soul
        A                 G/A
I don't need...   I don't need to hear you say
           F#m/A        Dsus2
That if we weren't so alike
                A
You'd like me a whole lot more
[Pre-Chorus]
D    D             A
     Listen to me now
  A                   F#m
I need to let you know
    F#m                   D    D
You don't have to go it alone
[Chorus]
          F#m                      E
And it's you when I look in the mirror
          D                             D
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
 F#m                  E                  D     D
Sometimes  you can't make it    on your own
[Bridge]
Fmaj7 - C - Dm
                I know that we don't talk
Fmaj7 - C   -   Am
            I'm sick of it all
Fmaj7 - C     -     Dm
           Can you  -  hear - me - when - I -
A      A        F#m                 F#m
Sing,       you're the reason I sing
D                 E         A                A
You're the reason why   the opera is in me...
       D       D
Well, hey now!
                    A
I've got to let you know
  A                           F#m
A house still doesn't make a home
      F#m             D     D
Don't leave me here alone...
[Outro/Chorus]
          F#m                      E
And it's you when I look in the mirror
          D                              D
And it's you that makes it hard to let go
F#m                  E                  D      D
Sometimes you can't make it    on your own
 F#m                 E
Sometimes you can't make it
              D                 D
The best you can  do    is to fake it
 F#m                 E           D            D
Sometimes you can't make it    on    your own
